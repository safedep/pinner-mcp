# Pinner MCP 📍

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that can help pin 3rd party dependencies to immutable digests.
Supported dependency types include:

- Docker base images
- GitHub Actions

## 📦 Usage

Run as a container with `stdio` transport.

```bash
docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/safedep/pinner-mcp:latest
```

### 💻 VS Code

Add the following to your `.vscode/mcp.json` file in your workspace. You must have the GitHub Copilot extension installed and enabled.

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "pinner-mcp": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--rm",
        "-i",
        "ghcr.io/safedep/pinner-mcp:latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Use GitHub Copilot Chat with prompts like:

```
Pin GitHub Actions to their commit hash
```

```
Pin container base images to digests
```

To update pinned versions, you can use a prompt like the following:

```
Update pinned versions of container base images
```

### 💻 Cursor

Add the following to your `.cursor/mcp.json` file. You must *enable*
the MCP server in the settings. Learn more [here](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol#what-is-mcp).

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pinner-mcp-stdio-server": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--rm",
        "-i",
        "ghcr.io/safedep/pinner-mcp:latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Use a Composer prompt like the following to pin a specific commit hash.

```
Pin GitHub Actions to their commit hash
```

```
Pin container base images to digests
```

To update pinned versions, you can use a prompt like the following.

```
Update pinned versions of container base images
```

### 🔄 Tool Updates

Updates for the MCP server are automatically pushed to the `latest` tag on
[GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/safedep/pinner-mcp/pkgs/container/pinner-mcp). You
must manually update your local container image to the latest version.

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/safedep/pinner-mcp:latest
```
